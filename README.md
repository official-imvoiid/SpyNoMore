# 🛡️ Project:  SpyNoMore  
**Protect your privacy. Defend your data. Burn the spies.**

## 🚧 UNDER CONSTRUCTION  
This code is still in the forge—  
built in fire, shaped by freedom.

## 🔥 Why This Exists

I believe in one core truth:

> **Privacy is a right, not a privilege.**

What you do online should be **up to you**—not your college, office, or some sketchy Wi-Fi provider snooping your packets like creeps behind a curtain.

No one has the right to spy on you.  
Not your admin. Not your ISP.  
**Only cybersecurity teams working for the safety of all** have that power—and even then, with purpose and consent.

This project is a digital weapon forged for **ethical defense**.  
Not to attack—but to **stand guard**.

## ⚔️ What It Does

- Blocks known network spying tactics used by Wi-Fi providers
- Detects packet sniffers, MITM setups, ARP poisoning attempts
- Monitors for suspicious behavior in shared/public networks
- Captures identifying data (IP, MAC, OS fingerprint, etc.) from possible attackers
- Logs all findings for **reporting and defense** purposes
- **Does NOT re-hack**—because even if you're under attack, retaliating is illegal

> **We trace. We log. We expose. Not attack.**

This tool follows the path of the white-hat:  
**We defend. We report. We stay clean.**
